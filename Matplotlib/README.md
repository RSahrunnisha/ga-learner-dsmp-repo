 Here we had to plot data in graphical presentation using matplotlib library and dataframes.


### Learnings from the project

 I learned to present and compare/read data in various graphical forms such as bar graphs, line graphs, scattered dot graphs, density graphs, etc.

 Challenge was to process the data in a manner to perfectly adapt in graphical form
